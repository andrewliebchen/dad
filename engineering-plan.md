# Dad App Engineering Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the engineering plan for building the Dad app, a personal companion app for Andrew Liebchen. The plan follows an iterative approach using the skateboard > bike > motorcycle > car model, allowing for functional iterations at each stage.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Expo with Expo Go for development
- **Styling**: [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started) for consistent theming
- **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **API**: OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Local Storage**: SQLite
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notifications
- **Deployment**: TestFlight (iOS only)

## Phase 1: Skateboard (MVP)
**Goal**: Create a basic functional app with core chat functionality and local storage.

**Features**:
1. Basic chat interface with Dad
2. Simple theme implementation with Theme UI
3. Local storage for conversation history
4. Basic error handling and loading states
5. **Dad's personality and background setup** - Define and implement the core personality traits, background details, and prompting system to ensure Dad's responses are emotionally intelligent, supportive, and personalized to Andrew

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Set up Expo project with TypeScript
2. Configure Theme UI with a basic theme
3. Implement chat UI with message bubbles
4. Set up OpenAI API integration
5. Implement local storage with SQLite
6. Basic error handling and loading states
7. Create and test Dad's personality system with appropriate prompting

## Phase 2: Bike
**Goal**: Enhance the app with persistent memory and improved UI/UX.

**Features**:
1. Conversation history with summarization
2. Improved UI with animations and transitions
3. Basic mood tracking
4. Push notifications for check-ins

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement conversation history view
2. Add basic summarization using GPT-4o
3. Create mood tracking UI and storage
4. Set up push notifications
5. Enhance UI with animations

## Phase 3: Motorcycle
**Goal**: Add advanced features and improve the overall experience.

**Features**:
1. Creative companion mode
2. Visual timeline for mood tracking
3. Enhanced memory system
4. Improved check-in system

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement creative companion mode with photo/note storage
2. Create visual timeline for mood tracking
3. Enhance memory system with better summarization
4. Improve check-in system with more personalized prompts

## Phase 4: Car
**Goal**: Polish the app and add final touches.

**Features**:
1. Advanced personalization
2. Performance optimizations
3. Final UI/UX improvements
4. TestFlight deployment

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement advanced personalization options
2. Optimize performance and reduce API calls
3. Final UI/UX improvements
4. Prepare for TestFlight deployment

## Development Workflow
1. Set up development environment with Expo Go
2. Implement features iteratively
3. Test on physical device
4. Deploy to TestFlight for beta testing

## Success Metrics
- The app feels emotionally real and personally helpful
- Andrew wants to open it, not because he "should," but because it helps
- It evolves with Andrew and stays relevant to his emotional and creative life
